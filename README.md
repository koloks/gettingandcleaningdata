### Introduction

The run_analysis.R script reads data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" and outputs a new - tidy - dataset utilising the principles outlined this course which will be available for further analysis.

Data contained in "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0‚Äùis derived  from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers in an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz data were captured. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

### The original dataset included the following data files:

features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': List of class labels and their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'train/subject_train.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

'test/subject_test.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

### A brief description of the script

The run_analysis.R script merges and consolidates data from .txt files and will output a tidy data set.

First level of checking is to to see if the required "reshape2" has been installed and then loads the "reshape2" package.

Subsequently it will reads all required .txt files and labels the datasets

In addition  the appropriate "activity_id"'s and "subject_id"'s are appended to the "test" and the "training" data, which are then combined into one single data frame

Utilising the "grep" function, all the columns with mean() and std() values are extracted and then a new data frame, including only the "activity_id", the "subject_id" and the mean() and std() columns, is created

Utilising the "merge" function, descriptive activity names are merged with the mean/std values dataset, to get one dataset with descriptive activity names

Finally utilising the "melt" and "dcast" functions of the "reshape2" package, the data is converted into a table containing mean values of all the included features, ordered by the activity name and the subject id, and the data is written to the "tidy_movement_data.txt" file.

Overviews or descriptions of the "tidy_movement_data.txt" file may be found in the "CodeBook.md" file.
